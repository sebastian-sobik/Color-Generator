<img src="./generator.gif" alt="GIF" width="220" height="450">

## **Main features** 🎆
* performance optimized sidebar
* locally saving colors
* enjoyable experience
* animations
* responsive design

## **Major challenges** 💪🏼
* designing sidebarManager object that loads colors in real time (while scrolling), manage added/deleted colors, manage toolbar nodes quantity,
* designing program that feels clean and clever and satisfies me

## **Once upon a time in the future** 🧙🏼‍♂️
* keyboard shortcuts notification for PC users 
* use tab to show sidebar 
* undo button  
* code refactor

## **Ideas for new features** 🚀
* Color profiles - user will be able to assign colors to groups
* Save all button - saving all colors as string

## **Important questions** 
* Is delegating events by .scrollable-sidebar better in case of optimalization than adding event listeners to each block-box?
  **I guess it is**.
